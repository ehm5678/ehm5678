<h1> 👋 Hi, I’m Elspeth - I'm a Full Stack Developer </h1>
</div>


I became interested in tech after paralegalling in a legal tech startup, and did some short coding courses outside of work in Python & SQL. I noticed how diversity is a big problem in the tech industry, and later joined Code First Girls, where I worked as a Senior Programmes Coordinator and organised online coding classes for women and non-binary people. I decided to use my passion for inclusive tech and creative problem solving with code to become a developer, and was accepted onto the School of Code’s BC17 bootcamp in 2024

- 🌍 Based in London, UK
- 📚 Since graduating in October 2024 I’ve been honing my skills in full-stack engineering. I’m currently working on a restaurant review app
- ✉️ Eager to apply my technical skills and interests in a Junior Full Stack Developer / Software Engineer role. Contact me via Linkedin
